1. Given this fragment,
class X {
    private int count;
}
is the following fragment correct?
class Y {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        X ob = new X();
        ob.count =10;
    }
}

Not correct because the variable count is private.

2. An access modifier must __________ a member’s declaration.
precede

3. The complement of a queue is a stack. It uses first-in, last-out accessing and is
often likened to a stack of plates. The first plate put on the table is the last plate
used. Create a stack class called Stack that can hold characters. Call the
methods that access the stack push( ) and pop( ). Allow the user to specify the
size of the stack when it is created. Keep all other members of the Stack class
private. (Hint: You can use the Queue class as a model; just change the way the
data is accessed.)

Answer in files Stack.java and StackDemo.java

4. Given this class,
class Test {
    int a;
    Test(int i) {
        a = i;
    }

}
write a method called swap( ) that exchanges the contents of the objectsreferred to by two Test object references.

    swap(Test t) {
        int temp = a;
        a = t.a;
        t.a = temp;
    }
    
5. Is the following fragment correct?

class X {

    int meth(int a, int b) { ...}
    String meth(int a, int b) { ...}

}

No it is not. OVerloaded methods must have different parameters, different return type is not enough.

6. Write a recursive method that displays the contents of a string backwards.

void reverse(String myString) {
    if (myString.length == 0) {
        System.out.println();
    } else {
        System.out.print(myString.charAt(myString.length - 1));
        reverse(myString.substring(0, myString.length - 1));
    }
}


7. If all objects of a class need to share the same variable, how must you declare
that variable?

static

8. Why might you need to use a static block?

if you want to do something before using your class.
Maybe download something from the Internet or make some calculations.

9. What is an inner class?

It is a class that is available only to the outer class that contains it.
The inner class has access to all members of the outer class.

10. To make a member accessible by only other members of its class, what access
modifier must be used?

private

11. The name of a method plus its parameter list constitutes the method’s
_______________.

signature

12. An int argument is passed to a method by using call-by-_______________.

value

13. Create a varargs method called sum( ) that sums the int values passed to it.
Have it return the result. Demonstrate its use.

int sums(int ... v) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (val : v) {
        sum += val;
    }
    return sum;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(sums(1,2,3,4));
}

14. Can a varargs method be overloaded?

Yes it can, but you need to be careful
about some case where it will be ambiguous and it can lead to errors.

15. Show an example of an overloaded varargs method that is ambiguous.

int sums(int ... v) {...}
int sums(boolean ... v) {...}

error if we call:
sums(); //not clear which function to call here

other case:
int sums(int ... v) {...}
int sums(int a, int ... v) {...}

error if we call:
sums(1,2); //not clear which function to call here again
sums(1); //same
