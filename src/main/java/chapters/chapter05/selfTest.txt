1. Show two ways to declare a one-dimensional array of 12 doubles.
Double[] myArray = new Double[12];
Double myArray[] = new Double[12];

2. Show how to initialize a one-dimensional array of integers to the values 1
through 5.
//declare it first
int[] myArray;
myArray = {1,2,3,4,5};

3. Write a program that uses an array to find the average of 10 double values. Use
any 10 values you like.
Double myArray = {1.0, 2.0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
Double average = 0;
for (int val : myArray) {
    average += val;
}
average /= 10;

4. Change the sort in Try This 5-1 so that it sorts an array of strings. Demonstrate
that it works.
Answer is the file: BubbleString.java

5. What is the difference between the String methods indexOf( ) and lastIndexOf(
)?
indexOf returns the first occurence if it exists.
lastIndexOf returns the LAST occurence if it exists.

6. Since all strings are objects of type String, show how you can call the length( )
and charAt( ) methods on this string literal: "I like Java".
"I like Java".length();
"I like Java".charAt(5);

7. Expanding on the Encode cipher class, modify it so that it uses an eight-
character string as the key.
answer in file: EncodeImproved.class

8. Can the bitwise operators be applied to the double type?
No

9. Show how this sequence can be rewritten using the ? operator.
if(x < 0) y = 10;
else y = 20;

y = (x < 0) ? 10 : 20;

10. In the following fragment, is the & a bitwise or logical operator? Why?
boolean a, b;
// ...
if (a & b) ...

It is a boolean operator because a and b are booleans.

11. Is it an error to overrun the end of an array? Is it an error to index an array with
a negative value?
Yes, they both are OutOfBound errors.

12. What is the unsigned right-shift operator?
It is shown as >>>
it is a right-shit operator that always adds 0 to the left.
(it is different from the right-shift operator , who adds 1 for negative numbers)

13. Rewrite the MinMax class shown earlier in this chapter so that it uses a for-
each style for loop.
done in MinMax.class

14. Can the for loops that perform sorting in the Bubble class shown in Try This 5-
1 be converted into for-each style loops? If not, why not?
It can not, because the for-each style loop is basically read-only.

15. Can a String control a switch statement?
Yes
