# Java_A_Beginner_Guide

This is a simple repo where I keep all my work on the book : "Java, a Beginner Guide".
The implementation of the examples might be slightly different from the book as I go along and try to reimplement them.

Check if everything compiles and respects the style imposed by our gradle settings:
